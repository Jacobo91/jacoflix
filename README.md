## This is a netflix clone using the natflix API from rapiapihub

## steps:

1. created simple layout for mobile only and added the trending gallery by fetching through a class constructor the 
trending class from the api and generating the results in the HTML

2. set the class constructior to accept more arguments so to use it with all the sections of the page 

3. instantiated the class constructor with the proper arguments for creating the recommended section 

4. add searchbar (works by gender - no name search added due to limited requests available uppon the API subscription plan so results are also restricted to only 20-)(would probably add a show more button than adds by 10 
requests up to 40-)

5 PENDIND: add rating to each item

6 PENDING: add functionality to nav bar buttons to display movies or series according to the button press and organize movies and series by gender with overflow-x: scroll;
